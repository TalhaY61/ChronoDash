Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is my first ever game created with Lua. 

## About the game
This game was developed using the Lua programming language and the LÃ–VE game engine. All pixel art was personally created by me where i just used google and reddit for the some ideas.
I used the "piskel" and "aseprite" software to create these pixels. For the background sound i found it on "Pixabay" and created the sound effect by myself with "jsfxr"
It is a 2D pixel-art game, which offers an adventure where you control a magical character who must dodge obstacles, use the time control ability to slow down the enviroment, and survive to achieve the highest score.

## Conclusion
This game is the result of many hours of hard work and creativity. Since it's my first game created with Lua, I wanted it to be easy to play and accessible.
I had a lot of fun and learned so much about Lua and the LÃ–VE framework while developing this game.
